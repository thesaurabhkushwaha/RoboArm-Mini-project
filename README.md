# RoboArm-Mini-project

* A C++ openGL project to simulate movements of a robot's palm and fingers in 3-D.
* This was submitted as "Mini project" under the "Computer Graphics and Visualization" subject of 6th semester (2019) BE CSE degree by me.

## Controls
* Finger controls (Keyboard):
  * 'M' and 'm': To move the middle finger.
  * 'I' and 'i': To move the index finger.
  * 'R' and 'r': To move the middle finger.
  * 'T' and 't': To move the thumb.
  * 'L' and 'l': To move the little finger.
 
* Wrist controls:
  * 'C' and 'c': Y-axis rotation.
  * 'W' and 'w': X-axis rotation.
  * 'Z' and 'z': Z-axis rotation.
  
  > C,W and Z were chosen as they lie close together on a QWERTY keyboard.

* Translation controls:
  * Arrow-Up    : Move palm upwards.
  * Arrow-Down  : Move palm downwards.
  * Arrow-Left  : Move palm towards left.
  * Arrow-Right : Move palm towards right.
  
* Scaling:
  * 'S' : Zoom-in
  * 's' : Zoom-out

* Others:
  * 'o' : Reset the model back to original state.
